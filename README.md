A very simple countdown clock.

The [icon](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=clock&i=5435) being used is by Andy Fuchs and was downloaded from the Noun Project.

## Build for NW.js

Countdown works in [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and can be run on any operating system.

You must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed to build for NW.js.

Once Node is installed install Gulp with the following command.

`npm install gulp -g`

To build for NW.js `cd` into the repo's root. 

Install all needed dependencies with NPM.

`npm install`

After this run `gulp build`.

This will create a `build` directory with Countdown built for OS X 64, Windows 32, Window 64, Linux 32, Linux 64.
